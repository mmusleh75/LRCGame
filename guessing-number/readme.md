# Guessing a Number
The idea is that you think about a number, and then the computer will try to guess that number based on your response. if you respond "H" for Higher or "L" for Lower, the computer will keep trying until you respond with "M" for Match. and then the program will show how many attempts it took the computer to guess your number.
